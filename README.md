# About the project

I made this project to learn git and github. The project includes applications such as calculator, [BMI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index) and clock.
All you need is Python to run it.

## My thoughts about tkinter
The best answer to the question "should I learn tkinter ?" If you have a lot of free time, why not?

However !
If you are going to make a real desktop application (GUI), learn what tkinter is and move on to the next step because you will most likely be using javascript or java.

Here's other people's opinion [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/107j4rw/is_it_worth_to_learn_tkinter_in_2023/)

Chatgpt's answer : Learning Tkinter can be worth it if you are interested in creating desktop applications using Python. 
Tkinter is a popular choice for building graphical user interfaces (GUIs) due to its simplicity and ease of use.
It's a good starting point for beginners and can be a valuable skill if you plan to work on Python-based desktop projects.
However, if you have specific requirements for more complex or modern GUIs, you may want to explore other libraries or frameworks.

Anyway, Python's aim is simplicity and fast writing (the syntax of the language is close to English).

If you are going to work on machine learning, you will use Python (Tensorflow, pandas, numpy, etc.).
The reason is that it is closer to English and you write less code than a Java developer (time and health are the most valuable treasures:) ).
